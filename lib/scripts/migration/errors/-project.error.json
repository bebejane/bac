As the climate crisis accelerates, how can residencies be testing grounds for new – and better – ways of living and working? This eight-episode series brings together artists, researchers and activists from across the Nordic region and Scotland to explore this question. The first episode will be released on Friday 27 January 2023, and monthly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Episode 4: <em>Baltic Art Center – Artists&#8217; Role in an Age of Climate Crisis</em> is now available. This episode features Rikke Luther and Nomeda and Gediminas Urbonas (Urbonas Studio), who discuss the potential, and the responsibilities, of art and artists in the context of climate change.</p>\n<p>Please visit NAARCA&#8217;s new <a href=\"https://naarca.art/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website</a> for more information on the partner residencies and NAARCA&#8217;s innovative programme.</p>\n"
